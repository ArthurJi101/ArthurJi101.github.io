                The FitnessGramâ„¢ Pacer Test is a multistage 
                aerobic capacity test that progressively gets mo
                re difficult as it continues. The 20 m
                eter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the s
                tart. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each 
                after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be com
                pleted each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run 
                in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second t
                ime you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is ov
                er. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.
